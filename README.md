# Todo X Factor

## Overview

Todo X Factor began as a [TypeScript tutorial](https://youtu.be/61v23Ce5SXA?list=PLU0pnXVbHLls62DwFOB35Kxq2bw4-EVBF) project led by [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode), aimed at building a simple todo application to learn TypeScript. Originally, the app featured basic functionalities such as adding items to a list, deleting an item, removing all items, and saving to local storage. Inspired to enhance the application, I embarked on a journey of adding new features and revamping the UI, drawing inspiration from a [design template](https://dribbble.com/shots/14100356-ToDo-App-UI) by [Alex Arutuynov](https://dribbble.com/alex_arutuynov).

The evolution of Todo X Factor includes a comprehensive UI overhaul, the introduction of task item categories, the implementation of observers for dynamic UI updates, and a restructured app divided into distinct sections: the hero section, the task list (app) section, the theme template section, and the item entry section. Additional improvements include focus lock for enhanced accessibility, a custom select box, and a redesigned task list menu offering options to clear all tasks or only completed tasks.

## New Features and Enhancements

- **UI Overhaul:** Inspired by a design template from Alex Arutuynov, the app now boasts a modern and intuitive interface.
- **Task Item Categories:** Introduced categories for better organization of tasks.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Implemented observers to refresh the UI automatically upon modifications.
- **App Structure:** Divided the application into several sections for improved user experience.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Added focus lock to ensure a more accessible interface.
- **Custom Select Box:** Developed a custom select box for a more cohesive design.
- **Tasklist Menu:** Redesigned the menu to include options for clearing all tasks or only completed tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** Enhances JavaScript with static type definitions, improving code quality and understandability.
- **HTML5:** The core markup language for structuring web content.
- **CSS3:** Empowers the styling of web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Enables dynamic and interactive web experiences.

## Future Improvements

- **Custom Categories:** Allow users to create their own task categories.
- **Enhanced CRUD Operations:** Introduce more CRUD functionalities for task items.
- **Task Scheduling:** Implement the ability to schedule tasks for future dates.
- **Search Functionality:** Add a feature to search through tasks.
- **Notifications:** Implement notifications to alert users about task deadlines or updates.
